# CodeTalks

Example code based on [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) template to support my talks.
Every branches is optimized for the current talk, for now I can't do a new project for every talk because I haven't so much time.
I'll try to improve in the next weeks.

## Get started

1. Clone this project in a folder of your choice;
2. Digit `npm i` to install dependencies;
3. Digit `npm run dev` to start the app;
3. Apis currently work with [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server);
